## 1. Description

I have created a Password Generator to create a secure Password option for each user.
When you open the application, you are greeted with an alert tell you to press "generate password button" to begin. The the user is given the the option of iputing the amount of characters in their password. They must choose between 8-128. if a number outside of those paramaters, or a letter is chosen, they will be asked agian to enter an acceptable number for the application.
the application will then tell the user how many character they have chosen.
The user is then given 4 options for character they want the password to be made up with.
The options are Uppercase Letters, Lowercase Letters, numbers and Special Characters.
They musyt choose at least one of the 4 options to be able to generate the password. If user says no to all options they will be directed to choose at least one.
The application will then generate password and then display it in the text box.
User will be able to selct and copy password for their own use.

Application will deploy live with no errors and all files can be seen in my Github Repository.
